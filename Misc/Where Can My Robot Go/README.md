## Where Can My Robot Go?

The idea of this challenge is to find the flag through checking the websites ``robots.txt`` file. 

**Step 1:**
Head to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page and search for the ip address given ``128.125.52.138``

You will see this page which is the contribution made to the page "Flag" by the user with that ip address

**Step 2:**
Click on the "diff" button to see what changes the user actually made to the page, and this is where you will find the flag

Thus the flag is simply ``cNi76bV2IVERlh97hP``
